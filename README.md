# AGEB locator: Python Tool for Retrieving AGEB Indicators from GPS Coordinates of Nanostores
This repository provides a Python-based tool designed to locate the AGEB (Basic Geostatistical Area) for a nanostore based on its GPS coordinates. By inputting latitude and longitude data, the tool returns AGEB indicator that can later be link to the information on nanostores from INEGI. 

Features:
* Simple Python interface for retrieving AGEB indicator.
* Use GPS coordinates of a nonasotore to identify the AGEB region.
